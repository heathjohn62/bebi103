    "## Problem 8.2: Microtubule catastrophe, 40 pts\n",

    "In this problem, we use data from [Gardner, Zanic, et al., Depolymerizing kinesins Kip3 and MCAK shape cellular microtubule architecture by differential control of catastrophe, *Cell*, **147**, 1092-1103, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037). The authors investigated the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, the switching of a microtubule from a growing to a shrinking state.  In particular, they were interested in the time between the start of growth of a microtubule and the catastrophe event. They monitored microtubules in a single-molecule [TIRF assay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection_fluorescence_microscope) by using tubulin (the monomer that comprises a microtubule) that was labeled with a fluorescent marker. As a control to make sure that fluorescent labels and exposure to laser light did not affect the microtubule dynamics, they performed a similar experiment using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. They measured the time until catastrophe with labeled and unlabeled tubulin. We will carefully analyze the data and make some conclusions about the processes underlying microtubule catastrophe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file `gardner_mt_catastrophe_only_tubulin.csv` (which you can download [here](../data/gardner_mt_catastrophe_only_tubulin.csv)), we have observed catastrophe times of microtubules with different concentrations of tubulin. To start with, we will consider the experiment run with a tubulin concentration of 12 ÂµM. So, our data set consists of a set of measurements of the amount of time to catastrophe. We will consider three models for microtubule catastrophe.\n",

    "This suggests that the occurance of catastrophe is a Poisson process, so it is a \"rare event\" that requires multiple subprocesses to lead it it. The parameter for the process, if it is exponential, $\\beta$, represents the characteristic rate of catastrophe, that is how often catastrophe happens in a certain amount of time. It can also be parametrized as $\\tau=1/\\beta$, the characteristic catastrophe time, which fits what we are given in our data. The Exponential distribution is a special case of the Gamma distribution where $\\alpha = 1$ and a special case of the Weibull distribution where $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\sigma=1/\\beta$\n",

    "This suggests that the occurance of catastrophe represents a specific number of occurances of a Poisson process, that is a discrete number of steps that occur at the same rate must occur for catastrophe to occur. There are two parameters for this distribution, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, where $\\alpha$ is the number of arrivals (or \"steps\") required to trigger catastrophe, and $\\beta$ is the rate of the arrivals. Thus, the characteristic catastrophe time is given by $\\alpha/\\beta$. \n"
