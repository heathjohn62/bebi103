Submissions of homeworks go in this directory.

You should tag your submission with `hw##_submission`. To
tag a commit, e.g., of homework 1, do

    git tag -a hw01_submission -m "Submission of homework 1"

Alternatively, you can use GitHub's browser-based tagging system.

Each homework *problem* must be committed as single Jupyter notebook.
The file names must be hw#.#.ipynb.
