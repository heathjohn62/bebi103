Log file for Exponential MCMC
n_eff / iter looks reasonable for all parameters.
Rhat looks reasonable for all parameters.
0 of 18000 (0.0%) iterations ended with a divergence.
1 of 18000 (0.005555555555555556%) iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 14.
  Try running again with max_treedepth set to a larger value to avoid saturation.
E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior.
