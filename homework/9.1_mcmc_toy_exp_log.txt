n_eff / iter looks reasonable for all parameters.
Rhat looks reasonable for all parameters.
10 of 16000 (0.0625%) iterations ended with a divergence.
  Try running with larger adapt_delta to remove divergences.
0 of 16000 (0.0%) iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 13.
E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior.
