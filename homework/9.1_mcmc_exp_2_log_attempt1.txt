Log file for Exponential MCMC

n_eff / iter looks reasonable for all parameters.
Rhat looks reasonable for all parameters.
0 of 16000 (0.0%) iterations ended with a divergence.
152 of 16000 (0.95%) iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 13.
  Try running again with max_treedepth set to a larger value to avoid saturation.
E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior.
