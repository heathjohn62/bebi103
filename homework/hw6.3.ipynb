    "## Problem 6.3: Analysis of FRAP data (40 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [homework set 4](hw4.html#Problem-4.1:-Analysis-of-FRAP-data-(40-pts)), we began analyzing a FRAP experiment by Nate Goehring and corworkers. You performed image analysis to obtain the mean fluorescence of the bleach spot versus time. In this problem, you will use those data to obtain estimates for the diffusion coefficient $D$ and chemical rate constant $k_\\mathrm{off}$ for the PH-PLCd1/PIP2 complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we are taking a simplified approach, but there is more sophisticated analysis we can do to get better estimates for the phenomenological coefficients. These are discussed in the [Goehring, et al. paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2010.08.033). Instead, we will use the the mean fluorescence of the bleached region, $I(t)$ to perform our analysis. As derived in their paper, \n",

Here, $I_0$ is the mean fluorescence in the bleach spot before bleaching. Note that this function is defined such that the photobleaching event occurs at time $t = 0$.\n",

    "Your task in this problem is to develop a generative model and then to find estimates for the parameters of the model. We will revisit this problem again later in the course and build a hierarchical model. For this problem, consider each of the eight trials separately and use optimization to find the MAP parameter values for each trial and make a Gaussian approximation of the posterior to give an approximate 95% credible region.\n",

    "- A formatting note: typically you would write “parameter ~ distribution” rather than “parameter = distribution”\n",
    "- It isn’t really fair game to construct priors for $D$ and $k_{off}$ based on the results from the paper in which the data have already been analyzed.  You should be constructing priors based on general previous biological knowledge… (-0.5 pts)\n",
    "- Your prior predictive checks look decent overall, and they were plotted well.  However, the recovery times seem a bit fast (< 3 seconds), and I would have lowered where my priors for $D$ and/or $k_{off}$ were centered after seeing those curves. (-0.5 pts)?\n",
    "- Your optimization took much longer to converge than expected, and I’m not sure why.  But it turned out ok I guess!\n",
    "- In constructing your 95% credible regions, 95% is actually 1.96 times the standard deviation, not 2.  It’s very close, but we were specific in asking for 95% rather than two standard deviations or 95.45%.  I won’t take off points, but be careful in the future.\n",
    "- I share your concern regarding the lack of overlap between the 95% confidence regions on your $D$ and $k_{off}$ parameter estimates.  Some of them are OK, but we saw a bit more overlap in our parameter estimates, despite our parameter values being of similar order of magnitude to yours.  Definitely within the realm of possibility though…"
