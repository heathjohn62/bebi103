    "An edge in an image is the border of a region of the image. A Laplacian of Gaussian filter can be used to find edges in an image by looking at the second derivative of the pixel values of the image and finding places where it crosses zero, denoting a peak or valley in the first derivative of the pixels of the image and thus denoting an edge. We need to use the Gaussian to reduce noise first because noise is amplified in the higher derivatives of the data, so if we do not apply the Gaussian blur the data is too noisy to resolve."
