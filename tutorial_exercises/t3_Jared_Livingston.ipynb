    "What is an ROI, and why is it an important concept in digital image processing?"

   "source": [
    "An ROI is a \"region of interest\" in image processing, so it is the area in the image or stack of images that we would like to study. This is an important concept because in the cases of large images or sets of images, it is possible that the majority of the data is irrelevant, so choosing the region of interest is important for making the data usable. In addition, especially with large sets of images, automatically setting the ROI can be extremely useful, but due to the limitations of image analysis software it is often necessary to set the ROI manually."

    "Gaussian Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, try to match these stories to the stories of named distributions. For those of you not familiar with baseball, a no-hitter is a game in which a team concedes no hits to the opposing team. There have only been a few hundred no-hitters in over 200,000 MLB games. The Belmont Stakes is a major horse race that has been run each year for over 150 years."

    "\n",
    "This is not really an exercise, but a point of curiosity for me. Tell me of an instance, if any, where you were burned by a data set not being what you thought it was that you could have avoided if you did data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't really think of specific instance that could have been avoided if I did data validation, although I have been burned by data sets before. The only one I could think of that may have been avoidable was a fluorescence data set analyzing gene expression by looking at signal intensity in Fiji. We were halfway through writing a paper when we realized our charts didn't match our raw data. We never actually figured out the problem, however, settling for a different data pipeline rather than fixing our old one due to time constraints, so I don't actually know what the problem was or whether it was avoidable through data validation."
