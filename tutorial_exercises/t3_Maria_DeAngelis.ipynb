    "What is an ROI, and why is it an important concept in digital image processing?"

    "ROI stands for region of interest and is the part of an image or stack of images that we want to study. The rest of the image is ignored. This is important becuase we often only want to analyze a specific part of an image, and automation is much easier and more efficient when calculations only have to be done on a small, standardized area."

    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "How would you expect each of the following to be distributed?\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** The amount of time between repressor-operator binding events.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know much about repressor-operator events, but judging from Google results, they are pretty frequent when a certain conditions are met and obviouly the time between them can't be negative. I would guess exponential or half normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** The number of times a repressor binds its operator in a given hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hm, I'm not sure. I assume that the specific conditions needed to trigger repressor-operator binding events are pretty rare and so an exponential distribution would be a good estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** The amount of time (in total minutes of baseball played) between no-hitters in Major League Baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also rare, exponential distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** The number of no-hitters in a Major League Baseball season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poisson\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** The winning times of the Belmont Stakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume that technological/medical advances have led to faster horses over time, but that doesn't factor into the representation of the data. Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, try to match these stories to the stories of named distributions. For those of you not familiar with baseball, a no-hitter is a game in which a team concedes no hits to the opposing team. There have only been a few hundred no-hitters in over 200,000 MLB games. The Belmont Stakes is a major horse race that has been run each year for over 150 years."
