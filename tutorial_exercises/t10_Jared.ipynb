    "Give an example of a situation where it is ok to throw out data you acquired.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is ok to throw out data we acquired if something went wrong with the measurement. It is not ok to throw out data because it is extreme without knowing or strongly suspecting something is wrong with the measurement, unless it is so extremem that the measurement is unphysical. Thus, for an example with microbiology, if we realize that we spiked a bacterial culture with the wrong substrate or we forgot an ingredient in the media, we can throw out the bacterial growth data. However, if we believe that we made the culture correctly, that our innoculation went correctly, that our culture was uncontaminated, and that our measurement devices worked properly, we should not throw out extreme data."

    "Using the MAP/error bar optimization method to summarize the posterior reduces the posterior to a Gaussian approximation, effectively undoing what is done in the Student-t method of dealing with outliers because the heavy tails of the distribution will be lost in the approximation. Using the good/bad data model does not run into this issue because the probability of being good or bad for each data point is written into the posterior in such a way that will survive the approximation. I'm not certain that this is how it works, but it seems to make sense."

    "The median plugin estimate assumes that the data generative process is Gaussian, so that the median and mean are equal. The median is immune to rare outliers in a way that the mean is not, so simply estimating the median instead of the mean as a statistic can provide a good estimate of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student-t likelihood also assumes that the data generative process is Gaussian, but it allows for larger tails depending on the number of outliers, so the parameter $v$ represents the level of strong outliers in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good-bad model works as a mixture model where data are defined as having a probability $w_i$ of being good and we specify error bars for good and and bad data, along with our standard statistical modeling."
