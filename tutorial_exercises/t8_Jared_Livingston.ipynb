    "The number of effective independent samples is less than the total number of samples because MCMC samplers do not draw independent samples, but rather correlated ones, so the number of effectively independent ones will necessarily be lower. To boost the number of effectively independent samples, you can either take more steps or thin the samples by not taking all of the samples in the chain, for example by taking only every fifth sample."
